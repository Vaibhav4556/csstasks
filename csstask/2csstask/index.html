          The “Rational Heat Motor” patented by the young German engineer Rudolf
          Diesel on February 23, 1893, is one of the epoch-making inventions of
          the modern era. It was an explosive idea that led, a few years later,
          to the merger of the two companies Maschinenfabrik Augsburg and
          Maschinenbau-Actien-Gesellschaft Nürnberg better known today as MAN
          and the development of the diesel engine.

          Manufacturers of large engines and related components face mounting
          pressures: they are expected to meet rising demands for engine output,
          while also reducing fuel consumption and emissions. New concepts for
          engines, injection systems, waste-heat recovery and drivetrain
          optimization are called for in order to overcome these challenges.
          Combining presentations and in-depth discussions, the international
          MTZ conference "Heavy-Duty, On- and Off-Highway Engines" offers you
          the ideal platform.

          Basing the engine on the superior endurance of Yanmar’s industrial
          diesel engine crankcase, together with optimized cooling systems and
          materials for heat resistance in high-temperature components such as
          cylinder head, intake and exhaust valves, and pistons, means that the
          endurance and reliability required of industrial engines is realized,
          even at the high combustion temperatures characteristic of
          stoichiometric combustion.
